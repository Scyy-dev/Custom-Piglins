# Custom Piglins
Adds a GUI that allows server admins to completely customise the drop table of [Piglin Bartering](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Bartering) in-game, using the same mechanics as vanilla loot tables.

An in-game editor provides the easiest way to add and remove items - rather than fiddle with config files, the wanted item can be created using any means (commands, creative, other plugins etc) in-game and added straight to the loot table. Data is saved to disk and effective as soon as the GUI is closed.
